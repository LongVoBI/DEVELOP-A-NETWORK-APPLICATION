# DEVELOP-A-NETWORK-APPLICATION

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository, titled "DEVELOP-A-NETWORK-APPLICATION," is dedicated to an assignment for the Computer Networks course from the first semester of the 2023-2024 academic year. The purpose of this repository is to host the code and related materials for developing a network application as part of the course requirements. The README file currently does not provide detailed information about the project, only stating the course and semester details.

## Objectives
- Build a simple application similar to a torrent client, enabling users to share and download files over a network.

## Analysis of Features and Technologies
As the README file does not contain further details, a deeper analysis of the repository's features and technologies requires examining the code and other files within the repository. Typically, a network application project might involve:
- üñ•Ô∏è *Socket Programming*: For establishing communication between clients and servers.
- üåê *Client-Server Models*: Implementing the architecture for user interactions.
- üì° *Protocols*: Utilizing protocols like TCP/IP for data transmission.

The implementation might include programming languages such as Python, Java, or C, depending on the course requirements. To provide a more detailed analysis, specific files and code implementations within the repository would need to be reviewed.
